# Documentation
Documentation will be updated soon until the development has done.\
This repo will be integrated with [user-service-graphql](https://github.com/vincen320/user-service-graphql) repository.

## Update May 14th 2023
Maybe this will be **deprecated** due to depedency used. I think it is broken because try use Interface for testing but always got errors.\
I'm pretty sure my code is very well written, had search and try some solution but still got the same error.\
Gonna update with another repository & dependency.\
