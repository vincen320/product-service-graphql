# Documentation
Documentation will be updated soon until the development has done.\
This repo will be integrated with [user-service-graphql](https://github.com/vincen320/user-service-graphql) repository.

## Update May 14th 2023
This will be **deprecated** due to depedency used. I think it is broken because try use Interface for testing but always got errors.\
I'm pretty sure my code is very well written, had search and try some solution but still got the same error.\
This can only be fixed if I use Object Types as Return type not Interface, but why I don't do it? Because the purpose of this repository is practicing implement Interface as Return type.\
Gonna update with another repository & dependency.\
